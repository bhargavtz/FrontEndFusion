# Accessibility Tips for Frontend Developers

By following best practices, you can create inclusive designs that comply with accessibility standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

## üåê Key Accessibility Practices

### 1. Use Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML improves accessibility by providing meaning to content.
- Use `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<article>` appropriately.
- Example:
  ```html
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to Accessibility First</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <article>
      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <p>Learn how to make your website more accessible.</p>
    </article>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>Contact us for accessibility audits.</p>
  </footer>
  ```

### 2. Provide Alt Text for Images
Alt text describes the purpose of images for users with visual impairments.
- Keep descriptions concise and meaningful.
- Avoid using "image of" or "picture of."
- Example:
  ```html
  <img src="keyboard.webp" alt="Mechanical keyboard with RGB lighting">
  ```

### 3. Ensure Sufficient Color Contrast
Proper contrast ensures text is readable.
- Use tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
- Example of good contrast:
  ```css
  body {
    color: #1a1a1a; /* Dark text */
    background-color: #ffffff; /* Light background */
  }
  ```

### 4. Use Keyboard-Accessible Navigation
Ensure users can navigate via the keyboard.
- Use `tabindex` for custom focusable elements.
- Avoid removing `outline` styles.
- Example:
  ```html
  <button tabindex="0">Click Me</button>
  ```

### 5. Add ARIA Attributes
ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) enhances interaction for assistive technologies.
- Use ARIA roles and attributes sparingly.
- Example:
  ```html
  <button aria-label="Submit Form">Submit</button>
  ```

### 6. Provide Clear Focus Indicators
Help users identify which element is active.
- Customize focus styles for better visibility.
- Example:
  ```css
  button:focus {
    outline: 2px dashed #1e90ff;
  }
  ```

### 7. Design Responsive Layouts
Ensure designs adapt to different devices.
- Use media queries and flexible units.
- Test designs on various screen sizes.

### 8. Write Descriptive Links
Avoid vague text like "click here."
- Example:
  ```html
  <a href="/guidelines">Read our Accessibility Guidelines</a>
  ```

### 9. Include Captions and Transcripts for Media
Captions help users with hearing impairments.
- Example:
  ```html
  <video controls>
    <source src="intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <track src="captions.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">
  </video>
  ```

### 10. Test with Accessibility Tools
Regularly test your site‚Äôs accessibility.
- Use screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS).
- Use browser extensions like Axe or Lighthouse.
